# IWH-ROLES
roles for IWH if everyone voted to just distribute roles instead of explaining them one by one on what they do and if you’re too lazy to join the DC server to look!


↷
# ✧ '  PATIENTS / GOOD .

'Fugitive' [VIGILANTE]: You have two bullets; figure out who the bad is and try to kill them. If you accidentally shoot an innocent person, your guilt will set in before you die. (If you kill an innocent person, you only have one night to live.)

'Witch' [SAVIOR]: You can resurrect anyone; the choice is entirely yours. Revive one individual on any given night.

'Officer' [DETECTIVE]: You can see hints for your target's role and select whether or not to reveal it to the public; the choice is yours.

'Assistant' [DOCTOR]:  Treat an injured or 'in need of help' (poisoned) patient. It is possible to purposely to not heal someone! It's your decision. (You can also guess whether someone will die each action. If you are correct, your target does not die.)

'Armed and Afraid' [VETERAN]: If you choose to go on alert, you will kill ANYONE that did their action on you. (If no one did, nothing happened. If someone did, they die: even if they're a part of the good team or not.) 3 bullets, and 3 risks.

'The REAL Officer' [JAILOR]: Jail someone for a night, blocking their action. You are able to communicate with them in the night and decide if you want to execute them off or not. Jailor's can ask for their role, ETC. (Executing is 2 uses only!)

'Leader' [SUPREME LEADER]: Your votes will be counted 2X! The twist is that you need to reveal your role first. (You can change someone's vote to someone else mid-voting. 2 TIME USE)

‘Spiker’ [TAVERN KEEPER]: Serve alcohol to your target, making them change their target if they did an action on someone. (If they didn’t, it will announce that they didn’t do an action publicly.)

# ✧ '  STAFF / MAFIA .

'Surgeon' [MAFIA]: Kill anyone and attempt to get away with it. The patient's lives are in your hands.

'Accomplice' [ASSASSIN]: Be able to kill two people only in the whole match.

'Nurse' [CONSIGLIERE]: Mute someone for a day, only allowing them to speak through: Emojis, kaomojis, morse code etc or expressions/pony town actions. Or if you're feeling special, you can check for people’s exact roles..

'Mental Therapist' [FRAMER]: Frame one clue to target a different person rather than your teammate. (Two uses only! + Your paragraph won't show, but making harmless actions alongside your actual action is fine. Harmless actions will show.)

'Pharmacist' [RAT]: Poison someone with a pill capsule, death is guaranteed after two nights unless the Doctor heals them.

‘Secretary’ [AMBUSHER]: You are able to target someone and wait until they make an action targeting one of your mafia teammates. If they did, you are able to kill them. (The host will instantly tell you if they had made an action targeting one of the mafias. So no worries, you can pre-type your killing action if you want.) You are able to change targets after 2 nights.

'Unarmed and Afraid' [LATROPHOBE]: Kills anyone who tries to protect them, or target them. (This goes for the whole round.


↷
# ✧ '  GUESTS / NEUTRAL .

[RETRIBUTIONIST]: Be able to use an ability from the dead's role the next night. (You are able to know their role once doing so.)

[CRUSADER]: Protect any person you wish to protect from the evil in the next night, but also block good/neutral actions as well.

[BUTLER]: Give someone cool food or drinks, ETC! Is it poisoned? Is it not poisoned? Who knows.

'Comedian' [JESTER]: Can pull funny, harmless pranks on people, but if you get voted out, you're able to kill someone in return.

'Arsonist' [PYROMANIAC]: Each night, you may visit a player and douse them in gasoline. In order to successfully kill them, you need to ignite them the next night. (Action will fail if the doctor heals the player before igniting in time.)

‘Custodian’ [GUARDIAN ANGEL]: Upon getting this role, you will be assigned a target you need to protect at all costs. (You are able to protect them on nights that block every action against them, but you don’t know if they’ve gotten targeted or not. So it’s like a 50/50. 3 uses only.) Your target will not know they have a Guardian Angel until you’ve made an action wanting to protect them, etc. (or talk to them in whispers lol.)

‘Hangman’ [EXECUTIONER]: Upon getting this role, you will be assigned a target that you need dead, or voted off. You will not be able to do anything, but once they are dead/voted off, you can kill freely but each person you target will bleed for a day before dying.

'Game-Master' [GAMBLER]: Getting this role, you get to live your life as a real gambler! Use the dice to roll ONCE in your actions. 1-20 = Nothing happens,  30-50 = Protected for the next night, 60-80 = Know someone's role, 90 = Poisoned, 95-100 = Free Revive on someone or yourself.

'Sleuth-Hound' [CONJURER]: Guessing your target's role correct will kill the target. Side with MAFIA or GOOD? Up to you! (KILLING IS 1 TIME USE)

‘Patient’ [AMNESIAC]: Remember who you are by selecting a dead player’s role, making the SAVIOR unable to revive your target and you steal their role as well.
