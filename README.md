# IWH-ROLES
roles for IWH if everyone voted to just distribute roles instead of explaining them one by one on what they do and if you’re too lazy to join the DC server to look!

# ✧ '  PATIENTS / GOOD .

'Fugitive' [VIGILANTE]: You have 2 bullets, try to figure out who the evil is and attempt to kill them. If you shoot an innocent on accident, your guilt will begin to seep in before dying. (Basically have 1 night to survive before dying if you get an innocent killed.)

'Witch' [SAVIOR]: One life to resurrect, it's all up to you. Revive anyone on any night.

'Officer' [DETECTIVE]: You are able to see hints for your target's role and choose if you want to reveal it to the public or not, it's your choice.

'Assistant' [DOCTOR]: You followed the SAVIOR, you've cured many injured people before, but never in your life have you tried to cure people while also being at risk. Heal an injured, or a 'in need of help' (poisoned) patient. You can purposefully not heal someone! It's your choice. (You can also predict if someone's gonna die or not, if you target them and they get killed/poisoned in the same night? They survive.)

'Armed and Afraid' [VETERAN]: You locked yourself in your patient room while holding a gun in your hands. You heard the news of someone dying– You didn't wanna risk it, too paranoid to. If you choose to go on alert, you will kill ANYONE that did their action on you. (If no one did, nothing happened. If someone did, they die: even if they're a part of the good team or not.) 3 bullets, and 3 risks.

'The REAL Officer' [JAILOR]: You worked at a prison cell, after breaking in this hospital to silently disguise yourself as a part of the group to not let any suspicions from the MAFIA or ■■■■. You've realized that they had noticed the exit of the hospital and boarded them up with sheets of iron, leading you to be stuck here. But with a lockpick, handcuffs and a gun. Jail someone for a night, blocking their action. You are able to communicate with them in the night and decide if you want to execute them off or not. Jailor's can ask for their role, ETC. (Executing is 2 uses only!)

‘Debater’ [SUPREME LEADER]: You’ve taken the leadership of the group of the hospital, wanting to bring justice and revenge to the people that had been trapped in this hospital to just get killed. Your votes will be counted 3X! The twist is that you need to reveal your role first. (Extra mechanic: You can change someone's vote to someone else mid-voting! 2 TIME USE)

‘Watcher’ [LOOKOUT]: A long discussion about how to escape this hospital, you and the DETECTIVE had teamed up. Making you both have somewhat the same abilities. You want to bring justice like them. You are able to stalk your target and see if they had done an action on someone, but you would not be able to know what kind of action or who they targeted.

‘Pranker’ [TRAPPER]: You wanted to help everyone here, you wanted to try helping the good people here, trapped in this godforsaken hospital. But all you have is just beartraps. Set a trap in your target’s room. Causing anyone that tried to target them be unable to do an action for the next night and for this night. (Basically their action doesn’t show.)

‘Drunkard’ [TAVERN KEEPER]: You were previously a bartender at a popular bar before getting kidnapped. If everyone's doing bad stuff in this hospital, why not do it too? Serve a bunch of alcohol to your target, making them change their target if they did an action on someone. (If they didn’t, it would announce that they didn’t do an action publicly.)

# ✧ '  STAFF / MAFIA .

'Surgeon' [MAFIA]: Being trapped and locked inside the hospital you worked at for a long time with a bunch of staff members and patients was already enough for you to crack apart more. You believed everyone in this world did not want to live, so why not end them off already so they would be happy? That was a great idea. Kill anyone and attempt to get away with it. The patient's lives are in your hands.

'Accomplice' [ASSASSIN]: You were in on with your staff’s mass slaughter. Simply because you also believed their beliefs. People in this world want their life to end nowadays. Be able to kill two people only in the whole match.

'Nurse' [CONSIGILERE]: You had figured out that your friend— The SURGEON was a part of this whole act of killing people one by one each night in this trapped hospital. It sounded crazy to you, it was sick. Well, until you got threatened that you would get killed if you exposed them. Being forced to help the SURGEON.Mute someone for a day, only allowing them to speak through: Emojis, kaomojis, morse code etc or expressions/pony town actions. Or if you're feeling special, you can check for people’s exact roles..

'Mental Therapist' [FRAMER]: Hesitantly being forced to sign a contract under the SURGEON’s name once you figured out who was a part of this scheme all along, Frame one clue to target a different person rather than your teammate. (Two uses only! + Your paragraph won't show, but making harmless actions alongside your actual action is fine. Harmless actions will show.)

'Pharmacist' [RAT]: You had previously worked here as a Pharmacist, giving in-need patients their prescribed medication. But what was the point in that now? Why not have some fun? Poison someone with a pill capsule, death is guaranteed after two nights unless the Doctor heals them.

‘Secretary’ [AMBUSHER]: Being driven insane being stuck in the same room, you lost it. Suddenly having a craving for blood, you are able to target someone and wait until they make an action targeting one of your mafia teammates. If they did, you are able to kill them. (The host will instantly tell you if they had made an action targeting one of the mafias. So no worries, you can pre-type your killing action if you want.) You are able to change targets after 2 nights.

'Unarmed and Afraid' [LATROPHOBE]: Hearing about being trapped in this hospital until they got sick or unwell for [■■■■] to end their lives once they did just made you feel even more sick. You were paranoid. Kill anyone who tries to protect you, or target you. (This is passive and goes for the whole round.)

# ✧ '  GUESTS / NEUTRAL .

[RETRIBUTIONIST]: You had recently discovered a ritual spell and gotten a shovel in the hospital. With that, you planned on digging underground for a dead person’s body to perform the ritual to become who the corpse truly was before. Be able to use an ability from the dead's role the next night. (You are able to know their role once doing so.)

[CRUSADER]: After hearing about the news of possible deaths, you planted a wish in your mind: To attempt to protect everybody trapped in here, no matter who it is. Protect any person you wish to protect from the evil in the next night, but also block good/neutral actions as well.

[BUTLER]: You had served water and food to the patients for such a long time already, but wouldn’t it be a little mischievous if you— pop a pill inside and let your target die when they accept it? You decide.

'Comedian' [JESTER]: Ah yes, the classic comedian that broke into the hospital! Can pull funny, harmless pranks on people, but if you get voted out, you're able to kill someone in return out of revenge and madness.

'Arsonist' [PYROMANIAC]: Disguised as a nurse, you crave for everyone here to burn alive. Each night, you may visit someone and douse them in gasoline. In order to successfully kill them, you need to ignite them the next night. (Action will fail if the doctor heals them before igniting in time.)

[SQUIDDO]: use exploits and learn what evidence they had left behind in their action!!! (extra mechanic: if u roll above 90 you get every party perms except remove members yeahhh)

'Sleuth-Hound' [CONJURER]: Guessing your target's role correctly will kill the target. Side with MAFIA or GOOD? Up to you! (KILLING IS 1 TIME USE)
