Ironveil Wraithmoor Hospital, or IWH for short, is a apocalypse hospital themed mafia, inspired off of *[Sheriff's Mafia]*, *[Bootleg TOS]* and others! 

In this MAFIA, you are a 'patient' along others, working together to try not to die by the corrupt staff after being trapped in the hospital but also try to get rid of the corrupt *(ps. the radiation outside is also lethal.)*

Some days may be interuptted with NPCS at the front door or known as *[EVENTS]*. Basing off the *[RELATIONSHIP POINTS]*, you can either get: A easier finding to the *[MAFIA/STAFF]* team by clue giving (Make your points above 1.), or a harder finding! (Make your points go into the negatives.)

 ***✧ '  PATIENTS / GOOD .***

[🍀] ɢᴏᴏᴅ/ᴘᴀᴛɪᴇɴᴛ:    'Fugitive' [VIGILANTE]: You have 2 bullets, try to figure out who the evil is and attempt to kill them. If you shoot an innocent on accident, your guilt will begin to seep in before dying. (Basically have 1 night to survive before dying if you get an innocent killed.)

[🍀] ɢᴏᴏᴅ/ᴘᴀᴛɪᴇɴᴛ:    'Assistant' [DOCTOR]: Heal a injured, or a 'in need of help' (poisoned) patient. You can purposefully not heal someone! It's your choice. (You can also predict if someone's gonna die or not, if you target them and they get killed/poisoned in the same night? They survive.)

[🍀] ɢᴏᴏᴅ/ᴘᴀᴛɪᴇɴᴛ:    'Sufferer' [VETERAN]: If you choose to go on alert, you will kill ANYONE that did their action on you. (If no one did, nothing happened. If someone did, they die: even if they're a part of the good team or not.) 3 bullets, and 3 risks.
