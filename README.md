# IWH-ROLES
roles for IWH if everyone voted to just distribute roles instead of explaining them one by one on what they do and if you’re too lazy to join the DC server to look!

# ✧ '  PATIENTS / GOOD .

[🍀] ɢᴏᴏᴅ/ᴘᴀᴛɪᴇɴᴛ:    'Fugitive' [VIGILANTE]: You have 2 bullets, try to figure out who the evil is and attempt to kill them. If you shoot an innocent on accident, your guilt will begin to seep in before dying. (Basically have 1 night to survive before dying if you get an innocent killed.)

[🍀] ɢᴏᴏᴅ/ᴘᴀᴛɪᴇɴᴛ:    'Witch' [SAVIOR]: Resurrect 1 dead person, it's all up to you to decide who. Revive anyone on any night.

[🍀] ɢᴏᴏᴅ/ᴘᴀᴛɪᴇɴᴛ:    'Officer' [DETECTIVE]: You are able to see hints for your target's role and choose if you want to reveal it to the public or not, it's your choice.

[🍀] ɢᴏᴏᴅ/ᴘᴀᴛɪᴇɴᴛ:    'Assistant' [DOCTOR]: Heal a injured, or a 'in need of help' (poisoned) patient. You can purposefully not heal someone! It's your choice. (You can also predict if someone's gonna die or not, if you target them and they get killed/poisoned in the same night? They survive.)

[🍀] ɢᴏᴏᴅ/ᴘᴀᴛɪᴇɴᴛ:    'Sufferer' [VETERAN]: If you choose to go on alert, you will kill ANYONE that did their action on you. (If no one did, nothing happened. If someone did, they die: even if they're a part of the good team or not.) 3 bullets, and 3 risks.
